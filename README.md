This project uses Selenium, a powerful tool for browser control, to automate the web game Cookie Clicker "https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" . The script simulates clicks on the cookie and autonomously purchases upgrades.


## Tools Used
- Python: Programming language used to develop the script.
- Selenium: Library used to automate the browser and interact with the game.
- Chrome WebDriver: Browser driver used by Selenium to interact with Google Chrome.

## Characteristics
 successfully automated interaction with the cookie clicker game, allowing continuous cookie acquisition without manual intervention. Some of the results and achievements obtained include:
- Automation of clicking the main cookie to obtain cookies.
- Automatic selection of the most expensive available upgrades.
- Efficient management of wait time and repetitive actions through the implementation of loops and timers.
- Obtaining the cookies per second count after a predefined period, allowing evaluation of automation efficiency.


## Results and Achievements
This project demonstrates how Python programming skills can be used practically for automating tasks on the web. It helps in understanding programming concepts better and improves real-life problem-solving abilities.
